### What is the project about

> [!NOTE]
> This repository is part of bigger project **ft_transcendence** from **42 school**. Check it out [here]( https://github.com/josephcheel/42-ft_transcendence.git)


This project is focused on developing a **3D web-based version of the classic Atari Pong game**, built using **Three.js** for rendering and interactivity. The game features enhanced modern graphics, immersive sound effects, and support for two players who can compete against each other using a different computer and keyboard for controls. 

### **Features**:  
  * **Modernized graphics** with enhanced 3D visuals.  
  * **Immersive sound effects** for a better gameplay experience.  
  * **Multiple-player support** connect with your own computer.  

### Technologies Used**:  
  * **Three.js** for 3D rendering.  
  * JavaScript for game logic and interactivity.  
  * HTML/CSS for UI elements (if applicable).  


## Required Software  

To compile and run the project, ensure you have the following installed:  

* **Make** – To manage the compilation process using the Makefile.  
* **Node.js & npm** – Required for package management and running a local development server.  
* **Three.js** – The core library for 3D rendering (installed via npm or CDN).  
* **A modern web browser** – Such as Chrome or Firefox, with WebGL support

Use make help to chekc the commands availeable, there are two the Development section and the Dockerized section

- This means you can run `make` followed by one of the listed commands to perform specific actions related to your project.  

## Build Instructions
> Compilation is managed through the Makefile rules.

### **DOCKERIZED DEPLOY**  
These commands are for managing the application using Docker:  

- **`make up`** – Starts the application using Docker (this is the default command if no other option is specified).  
- **`make down`** – Stops the application running in Docker.  
- **`make re`** – Restarts the application in Docker (useful if you need to restart without rebuilding the image).  
- **`make re-img`** – Restarts the application in Docker, but also rebuilds the Docker image, ensuring that any changes are applied.  
- **`make clean-cache`** – Cleans the Docker cache, useful for freeing up space or clearing outdated images.
